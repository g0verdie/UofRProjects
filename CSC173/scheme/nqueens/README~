1. backtracking
	-start with empty board
	-add queens one at a time until we win
	-backtrack as needed
`	-end condition- place n queens
		-count to n to win
	-tree generated by nested calls in recursive search
		-search nodes are states
		-tree is induced in subroutine calling stacks
	-search function
		-find open column
		-put in queen
		-on fail try again
		-search col 0 on first level of search
		-search col 1 on next
2. minconflicts
3. report consistency checks/comparisons/num of operations
4. how does work needed grow with problem size?
	-use mean
5 tweak parameters
	1. min-conflicts
		-initialize board with random placement or greedy algorithm for minimal conflict
		-choose form col with most conflicts
