TA's name: Ru Zhao

There is only one file in this java project. All 5 parts of the lab are combined in the file.
Part 1 I aksed for the age and name of a person, and calculated his/her age in two years until he/she grows up to 30 years old.
Part 2 I set the initial number of player as 2, and triple the number until number of player reaches 23.
In part 3 I asked for user's name. If user's name is Fan, after entering the salary, the while loop will double the salary number. If user's name is not Fan, the program terminates.
In part 4, I converted the letter grade A, B ,C etc into corresponding integers and ask users to enter the letter grade they get for each test. With the user's input, the program calculates the average a user get for several test and then converts it back into more specific letter grade.

Description of the lab: Use conditional statement(if) and while loop to excute programs.
